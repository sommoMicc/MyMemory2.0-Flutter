# Android restoration — verified Play Console record

Verified read-only on **5 November 2026**, in the user's existing signed-in Google
Play Console browser session. No Console fields, releases, declarations or signing
settings were modified. No Play Developer API credential or connected Play tool
was available in this task, so these facts were read directly from Console UI.

## Existing app

| Field | Verified value |
| --- | --- |
| App name | MyMemory |
| Package/application ID | `com.michele.mymemory` |
| Console app ID | `4975576173768407729` |
| Developer account ID | `5468026965874523214` |
| App-level publication status | **Non pubblicata** (Unpublished) |
| Home-page last update | 26 November 2018 |
| Latest and only uploaded artifact | APK, **versionCode 2**, **versionName 0.9** |
| Artifact upload time shown in Console | 16 October 2015, 13:59 |
| Production release | 0.9; historical rollout 100%; release details show 16 October 2015 |

The **Tutti gli app bundle** page showed one row only and disabled next-page
navigation, so the highest observed uploaded versionCode is **2**. The release
overview labels the old production release as available on Google Play; the
account home explicitly marks the app **unpublished**. The release label does not
establish that the listing is currently visible to new users. The 2018 home-page
update should not be interpreted as a newer binary release.

- [Signing management](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/5468026965874523214/app/4975576173768407729/keymanagement)

## Signing requirement

The **Protetto con Play** overview explicitly states **Release non firmate da
Google Play**. Signing management presents an enrollment flow headed **Consenti a
Google Play di gestire la chiave di firma dell'app**, with the unselected option
**Usa chiave di firma dell'app esistente dell'archivio chiavi Java**. Therefore this
existing app is **not enrolled in Play App Signing**.

Updating this listing requires the original release signing key. A newly created
key or an Android debug key cannot update installations signed with the original
key. No enrollment option was selected and no signing key was uploaded. The old
local versionCode-1 APK's debug certificate is not proof of the versionCode-2 Play
release certificate; see `legacy/AUDIT.md`.

The modern project already preserves `applicationId = "com.michele.mymemory"`.
Its new versionCode must exceed 2 (the prepared 30001 does). A store-ready Android
release remains dependent on locating and verifying the original keystore and
its password/alias; these credentials must stay outside source control.

## Console requirements visible for the next release

The **Testa e rilascia** page listed these required incomplete declarations:

- Privacy policy.
- Target audience and content.
- Data safety.
- Financial features.
- Health apps.

These were observed only; they were not completed or submitted. Public privacy
and support pages for the restored service are available at
`https://mymemory.sommomi.cc/privacy` and `/support`, but Console declarations still
need to reflect the final app behavior and the user's intended audience.

No Android upload, production submission or republishing action was performed.
